Our goal here is to create a common database for the glucose level of 50 to 150 kids at camp Carowanis where the data is
provided by continuous glucose monitoring devices. These devices are currently able to relay data to smartphones but we want
to replace the smartphone since not all the kids at camp have a smartphone.

Using Firebase as our authentication serivce.
